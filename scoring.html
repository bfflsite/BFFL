<tr><td>Weekly Lineups</td>
    <td>Lineups carry over from week to week.  Lineup changes are allowed as
    long the game has not started for all players being inserted or removed.
    Any players that are on a bye that are left active in a lineup will be
    automatically replaced with the highest drafted player at the same
    position, without regard to injury status.  Players on bye that were not
    replaced prior to 1:00 Sunday are stuck with the automatic replacement,
    unless the automatic replacement and the player being inserted for him
    are in games that have not started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Week 17 Lineups</td>
    <td>All owners have an additional option in week 17 for their lineups.
    Instead of activating a player in week 17, a player may be deferred so
    that the fantasy statistics from the player's first NFL playoff game
    count instead.  All weekly lineup rules apply, including that deferred
    players may be inserted or removed as long as the game has not started
    for the players being switched.  If a player is deferred that is on a
    team that is not in the NFL playoffs, then that player may only be
    replaced with a player that is in the NFL playoffs.  Some players have a
    first round playoff bye, so the scoring for week 17 continues over a
    three week period.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tiebreakers</td>
    <td>If a game is tied, then the win will go to the owner that has the
    most points when kickers are eliminated from the lineups.  Rookie kickers
    in the rookie slot are not eliminated.  In the unlikely event that a game
    is still tied, then the win will go to the owner with the most points for
    the year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Trading Deadline</td>
    <td>Owners that have not been eliminated from the fantasy playoffs are
    only allowed to trade with owners that have not been eliminated from the
    fantasy playoffs.  Owners that have been eliminated from the fantasy
    playoffs are only allowed to trade with owners that have been eliminated
    from the fantasy playoffs.  There are no limits to the number of trades
    an owner can make.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pick Up Amount</td>
    <td>Each owner gets five pick ups.  An additional pick up is awarded for
    each player that is either placed on IR or cut and not on an NFL roster,
    prior to the end of the week 15 games (fantasy playoff start).  All pick
    ups may be traded.  An untradable free pick up is awarded for each
    player drafted that is cut and not on an NFL roster, as long as the
    player is replaced prior to the start of regular season.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pick Up Deadline</td>
    <td>Pick up requests that are made prior to midnight Tuesday will not be
    granted until Wednesday morning.  The priority order is based on win/loss
    record first, and then on points for the year second.  Making a pick up
    puts an owner at the end of the priority order for any additional pick
    ups.  The priority order resets each week.<br><br>
    After midnight Tuesday, all pick ups are first come, first served until
    1:00 Sunday, or at the kickoff of that player's game if it is
    sooner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scoring Changes</td>
    <td>Any scoring changes or scoring mistakes must be noticed and settled
    prior to 1:00 Sunday of the following week.  After that, all scoring is
    final.</td></tr>
